# üñºÔ∏è SOC Simulation ‚Äì UI Screenshots

This folder contains user interface screenshots from my fully custom-built SOC (Security Operations Center) simulation project. Each image reflects a different core feature of the simulation, built to model real-world alert management, threat intelligence, log analysis, and analyst workflow.

- Total alerts in the past 24h
- Open cases
- Alerts by severity (donut chart)
- Live threat picture with top attacker and target IPs

---

## üö® Alerts Feed

**File:** `Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 15-44-36 SOC Simulator - Final.png`  
Displays real-time alerts with:
- Severity labels (Critical, High, Low, etc.)
- Source and destination IPs
- Descriptions of attack types like SQL Injection, Malware, Port Scans

## üß† Threat Intelligence

**File:** `Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 15-45-00 SOC Simulator - Final.png`  
Built-in threat intel lookup tool that:
- Analyzes IP addresses
- Returns a risk score
- Displays known tags, history, and location based on threat feed data

## üë§ Analyst Profile

**File:** `Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 15-45-06 SOC Simulator - Final.png`  
Displays analyst progress with:
- Leveling system
- XP tracking
- Unlockable achievements for SOC performance (e.g., detecting false positives, escalating alerts)

## üîß Technical Note

This entire UI is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks), with Gemini AI generating alert content and metadata. The simulation mimics a real SOC workflow and is fully customizable for training or demonstration purposes.
